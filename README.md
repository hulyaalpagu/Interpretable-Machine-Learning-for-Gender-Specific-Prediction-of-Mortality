This work aims to find the predictors of all-cause mortality by developing a machine learning model that is gender-specific and interpretable. To help personalized dissemination of urgent care.

The Texas Public Use Data File contains data on discharges from Texas hospitals.

For this study, data from Texas hospital Inpatient Discharge General Use Data File containing 1,493,150 patient records of 710,385 male and 782,765 female were analyzed. 

As we review the patient records, it becomes evident that the data exhibits nearly equal distribution between male and female.

We used three machine learning models : Logistic Regression with Ridge and Lasso, and Gradient Boosting with Ensemble learning to predict gender-specific mortality risk.
